                    <p>Being an art and technology enthusiast, I
                        spend extreme amounts of time exploring and learning on how I can be able to create modern solutions to everyday life problems using Technology and Art. I believe that technology is the key to solving world problems, especially in Africa. It is my dream to make that positive impact using this powerful tool. I'm passionate about computer  programming, especially in the Web Development field and automation.
                        Aside from coding, you can find me at networking events or community building events, or with friends. I love traveling, reading, eating, creating digital artworks and designing.
